# 🌍 Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction – Rawalpindi

This project predicts the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** for **3+ days ahead** in Rawalpindi using advanced machine learning and deep learning models.  
It was developed during my internship at **10Pearls Pakistan** under the **Shine Internship Program**.
